# Python Pantry – Smart Recipe Finder

**TRY IT OUT! [Python Pantry](https://pythonpantry.pythonanywhere.com)**

A personalized recipe discovery app built with **Flask**, **JavaScript**, and the **Edamam Recipe API**, helping users find recipes based on ingredients, dietary needs, allergies, or pure laziness (via the *I'm Hangry* randomizer).  
Users can save recipes, manage favorites, and enjoy a clean, responsive experience across devices.

## Features

### Smart Recipe Search
- Search recipes by entering ingredients you already have.
- Filter by **diet types** (vegan, keto, vegetarian, etc.).
- Filter by **allergies** (gluten-free, dairy-free, peanut-free, etc.).
- Filter by **cuisine** (Italian, Japanese, Mediterranean, etc.).
- Auto-generated ingredient chips and autocomplete behavior.

### “I’m Hangry” Randomizer
- Picks a random cuisine.
- Automatically runs a real search with cleared filters.
- Fully Firefox-compatible after fixing event issues.

### Favorites System
- Users can log in and save recipes.
- Recipes stored in MySQL with downloaded image caching.
- Displays the **3 most recently added favorites** on the home page.
- Duplicate protection prevents saving the same recipe twice.
- Delete favorites from anywhere in the app with auto-refreshing UI.

### Hardcoded Featured Recipes
- Showcased on the home page.

### Dark Mode
- Persistent theme toggle (light/dark).
- Oauth user avatar remains unchanged in dark mode.
- Manual profile icon swaps to dark-friendly chef icon.

### Fully Responsive UI
- Mobile sidebar menu with sliding animation.
- Desktop layout adjusts based on viewport sizes.
- Recipe cards feature image flip animation + hover details.
- Smooth transitions and polished visual design.

## How It Works

- Communicates with the Edamam API for recipe search.
- Normalizes API response for consistent frontend usage.
- Stores favorites in MySQL with a downloaded thumbnail.
- Prevents duplicate favorites using SQL queries.
- Serves cached recipe images via `/recipe_image/<id>` route.

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Event-driven JavaScript controls searching, saving, deleting, filtering.
- Dynamic rendering of recipe cards with flip animations.
- Firefox-specific compatibility fixes.
- Redirects unsafe/broken URLs to Google with an explanation popup.
- Clean, modern UI styled in CSS with responsive layout and transitions.

source venv/bin/activate
# or Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set environment variables  
Create a `.env` file:

```

EDAMAM_APP_ID=your-app-id
EDAMAM_APP_KEY=your-app-key
MYSQL_USER=...
MYSQL_PASS=...
MYSQL_DB=...
